          Content Credentials use technology that makes it clear if content has
          been altered since its Content Credentials were created. Up-to-date
          context travels with the content, wherever it goes.

          Devices, software, and organizations that issue Content Credentials
          identify themselves in the Content Credentials they issue. Issuers
          therefore stake their reputations on their ability to record
          information accurately.
